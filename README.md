# ASHA Engine

A typed Go research engine for the finite Boolean--Octonionic source program.

The engine is intentionally theorem-gated:

1. exact algebra first;
2. variational finite dynamics second;
3. gauge and topology tests third;
4. bridge-layer physics last.

No observed physical constants are hard-coded in the finite core.

## Current gates

- `ALG-EXT-GRADES-R8` — exterior grade structure of `R^8`.
- `ALG-CLIFFORD-CL-1-7` — Clifford algebra `Cℓ(1,7)` bookkeeping.
- `PHY-PHASE-COVARIANT-4D` — covariant phase-space split `x_mu + p_mu`.
- `GEO-BOOL-INCIDENCE-R8-L3-U4` — Boolean incidence `Λ^3R^8 -> Λ^4R^8`.
- `GEO-G2-CALIBRATION-L4-R8` — octonionic `G2` rank-14 calibration sector.
- `GEO-CONTACT-K-BG-L4-R8` — contact space `K = Im(P_B) ∩ Im(P_G)`.
- `DYN-BSECTOR-CONTACT-VACUUM` — finite B-sector action whose zero modes are `K`.
- `GAUGE-G2-R-CENTRALIZER` — tangent-level centralizer `g2^R ≅ su(2) ⊕ u(1)`.
- `GAUGE-BOOLEAN-LIFT-COMPRESSION` — harsh Boolean compression diagnostic.
- `GAUGE-BOUNDARY-FIXED-CLOSURE` — minimal boundary-fixed Lie-closure growth diagnostic.

## Current truth from the gauge branch

The contact-preserving tangent algebra exists:

```text
g2^R ≅ su(2) ⊕ u(1)
```

But the naive Boolean lift/compression does **not** produce a closed finite
`su(2) ⊕ u(1)` algebra. After imposing the contact boundary, the generated
finite Lie algebra continues growing beyond the four seed generators. This is
not hidden or patched: the engine reports it as an open theorem failure and a
new structural constraint.

## Run

```bash
go test ./...
